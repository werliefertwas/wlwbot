Reminder loads a csv file containing cronstrings with messages and sends the messages at the appropriate time.

Editor listens for messages to edit a csv. Try "reminder help"!

- create jobs per user and/or channel
- explicitly handle concurrency issues when writing csv
- use a nicer backend (e.g. RethinkDB to push changes)
- sync with Outlook :P
- ...
